OKRs, or objectives and key results, are a popular goal-setting method used by many companies and organizations to drive progress and achieve success. While they are often used to set positive goals and targets, such as increasing revenue or improving customer satisfaction, there is also value in setting negative OKRs. In the context of community building, negative OKRs can help to prevent harmful behaviors and foster a more positive and inclusive environment.

# What are negative OKRs?

Negative OKRs, also known as inverse OKRs, are goals that are framed in a way that focuses on avoiding negative outcomes or behaviors. For example, instead of setting the goal of "increasing customer satisfaction," a negative OKR might be "preventing customer complaints." Negative OKRs can be a useful tool for organizations that want to prevent certain behaviors or outcomes, and they can be especially effective in community building.

# Why are negative OKRs needed for community building?

In any community, there are likely to be individuals who engage in behaviors that are harmful or disruptive to the group. These behaviors can range from bullying and harassment to spreading misinformation and engaging in divisive discussions. Left unchecked, these behaviors can undermine the sense of community and inclusivity that organizations are trying to foster.

Negative OKRs can help to prevent these harmful behaviors by setting clear goals and targets for avoiding them. For example, an organization might set a negative OKR of "reducing instances of bullying by 50% within the next quarter." This goal provides a clear target for the organization to aim for and can help to focus efforts on preventing bullying.

Additionally, negative OKRs can help to create accountability within the community. By setting clear goals and targets for avoiding negative behaviors, organizations can hold individuals accountable for their actions and create a culture of responsibility and respect. This can help to foster a more positive and inclusive environment within the community.

# How can negative OKRs be implemented in community building?

There are several steps that organizations can take to implement negative OKRs in their community building efforts:

    Identify the negative behaviors that need to be prevented. This might include bullying, harassment, spreading misinformation, or engaging in divisive discussions.

    Set clear and specific goals for avoiding these behaviors. For example, "reducing instances of bullying by 50% within the next quarter."

    Measure progress towards these goals using specific and quantifiable metrics. For example, tracking the number of instances of bullying reported by community members.

    Provide support and resources to help individuals avoid engaging in negative behaviors. This might include training on appropriate behavior, providing resources for addressing conflicts, or implementing policies to prevent harmful actions.

    Create accountability by regularly reviewing progress towards the negative OKRs and taking action to address any issues or challenges.

By implementing these steps, organizations can effectively use negative OKRs to prevent harmful behaviors and create a more positive and inclusive environment within their communities.

# Conclusion

Through setting clear goals and targets for avoiding negative behaviors, organizations can prevent harmful actions and create a more positive and inclusive environment. By a negative OKR framework and regularly reviewing progress towards them, organizations can foster a culture of responsibility and respect within their communities.
