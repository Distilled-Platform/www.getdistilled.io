We are excited to announce the launch of Distilled, a new community strategy platform that we hope will assist developers with creating actionable strategy from the massive amounts of analytics they generate on a day to day basis. 

The motivation comes from the fact that a lot of CMs and DevRel we've spoken with are often aware of how to gather data from their tools, but usually have no idea how to use all the numbers that they put out. It's like there's all these metrics from these tools but no actionable steps because the data has been generated with no course. 

In many ways we believe this to be a natural progression of the community tools space, as when there are so many tools creating metrics, eventually there needs to be a way to build a plan around that. 

That's why we created Distilled.

# What is Distilled?

Distilled is a platform that helps community managers and leaders set, track, and measure the success of their goals. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a user-friendly interface that makes it simple to create and manage objectives and key results.

Unlike traditional OKR platforms, Distilled is not limited to a specific set of goals or metrics. Instead, it allows community managers to define their own goals and metrics, and to track progress in real-time. This allows communities to set and achieve their own unique goals, rather than being restricted by a one-size-fits-all approach.

# Key Features of Distilled

Distilled has a number of key features that make it an effective tool for managing community strategy. These include:

    - Customizable goals and metrics: With Distilled, community managers can define their own goals and metrics, and track progress in real-time. This allows communities to set and achieve their own unique goals, rather than being restricted by a one-size-fits-all approach.

    - Collaborative planning: Distilled allows multiple team members to collaborate on goal-setting and tracking, making it easy for communities to work together towards a common vision.

    - Automatic updates: Distilled automatically updates key results in real-time, so community managers can see the latest progress on their goals at any time.

    - Detailed reporting: Distilled provides detailed reports on goal progress, so community managers can see exactly where their community is succeeding and where there may be room for improvement.

    - Integration with other tools: Distilled integrates with other tools that community managers may be using, such as project management software and communication platforms, making it easy to track progress and stay on top of priorities.
